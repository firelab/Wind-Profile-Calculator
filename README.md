## Technologies Used 

1. React
  - Chosen for user responsiveness, already used at the lab, and works well as the project gains complexity
2. Python
  - Chosen for ease of use and learning opportunity with defining SWIG Bindings
  
## Frontend Overview

1. cd into frontend
2. install the neccessary dependencies
3. run npm start to create the build folder
4. run npm run to host the frontend
  - should be hosted at http://localhost:3000

## Backend Overview

1. cd into Wind Profile Calculator/backend
2. set up a virtual environment for the dependencies of python
  - the SWIG Bindings will requires python 3.8.10
3. run python3 backend.py to host the server locally

### Computation Code

1. Canopy Flow can be found at
2. The Log Profile Calculator can be found at
